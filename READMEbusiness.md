### Responses were provided following an interview session with the client.

1. **What are the Business Objectives?**
   - The client aims to visually differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those infected with powdery mildew and predict the health status of cherry trees.

2. **Can any business Objective be done with conventional Data Analysis?**
   - Yes, conventional data analysis suffices for visually distinguishing healthy and infected cherry leaves.

3. **Does the client need a Dashboard or an API?**
   - The client requires a dashboard featuring:
     - Image montage distinguishing infected and non-infected leaves.
     - Visualization of average image and standard deviation for both infected and non-infected cells.
     - Difference visualization between average infected and non-infected leaves.
     - Capability to predict leaf infection status.

4. **What does the client consider to be a success?**
   - A functional dashboard meeting business requirements, including leaf analysis for infection detection and prediction.

5. **Are there Epics and User Stories?**
   - Yes, aligned with the ML life cycle:
     - Information gathering and data collection.
     - Data visualization, cleaning, and preparation.
     - Model training, validation, and optimization.
     - Dashboard planning, design, and development.
     - Dashboard deployment and release.

6. **Are there ethical or privacy concerns?**
   - Yes, data provided under an NDA should only be shared with authorized project personnel.

7. **Does the data suggest any models?**
   - Binary Image Classification for distinguishing healthy and infected cherry leaves.

8. **What are the model inputs and outputs?**
   - Inputs: Images of cherry leaves.
   - Outputs: Diagnosis of leaf health status (sick or not sick), potential time of sickness onset.

9. **What are the performance criteria?**
   - Agreed upon a minimum accuracy level of 97%.

10. **How will it benefit the client?**
    - Automated detection of Mildew-infected cherry plants, facilitating timely treatment and reducing manual diagnosis efforts and costs.
    - Acceleration of testing results, reduction of manual processes in diagnosing infections, and mitigation of Mildew propagation.
