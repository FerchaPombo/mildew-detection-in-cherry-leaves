## Codeanywhere Template Instructions

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions. Click the `Use this template` button above to get started.

You can safely delete the Codeanywhere Template Instructions section of this README.md file,  and modify the remaining paragraphs for your own project. Please do read the Codeanywhere Template Instructions at least once, though! It contains some important information about the IDE and the extensions we use. 

## How to use this repo

1. Use this template to create your GitHub project repo

1. Log into <a href="https://app.codeanywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CodeAnywhere</a> with your GitHub account.

1. On your Dashboard, click on the New Workspace button

1. Paste in the URL you copied from GitHub earlier

1. Click Create

1. Wait for the workspace to open. This can take a few minutes.

1. Open a new terminal and <code>pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code>

1. In the terminal type <code>pip3 install jupyter</code>

1. In the terminal type <code>jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.token='' --NotebookApp.password=''</code> to start the jupyter server.

1. Open port 8888 preview or browser

1. Open the jupyter_notebooks directory in the jupyter webpage that has opened and click on the notebook you want to open.

1. Click the button Not Trusted and choose Trust.

Note that the kernel says Python 3. It inherits from the workspace so it will be Python-3.8.12 as installed by our template. To confirm this you can use <code>! python --version</code> in a notebook code cell.


## Cloud IDE Reminders

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you, so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.


## Dataset Content

* Dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). Subsequently,  a hypothetical user scenario was created to demonstrate the practical application of predictive analytics in a workplace project.
* The dataset comprises over 4,000 images captured from the client's crop fields. These images depict both healthy cherry leaves and leaves afflicted with powdery mildew, a fungal disease that poses a threat to numerous plant species. Given the cherry plantation's significance within their product portfolio, the company is deeply invested in ensuring the market receives products of uncompromised quality.



## Business Requirements

* The cherry plantation at Farmy & Foods faces a challenge with powdery mildew affecting their cherry trees. Currently, manual inspection takes around 30 minutes per tree, with an additional minute for applying treatment if needed. With thousands of trees across multiple farms, this process is not scalable. To address this, the IT team proposed implementing an ML system to instantly detect powdery mildew in cherry tree images. If successful, this approach could be extended to other crops. The dataset comprises cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods.

# Business Objectives:

* Conduct a study to visually differentiate healthy cherry leaves from those with powdery mildew.
* Predict whether a cherry tree is healthy or afflicted with powdery mildew.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* Hypothesis: 
Plants affected by fungal infestation, specifically powdery mildew, exhibit distinct visual characteristics on their leaves, such as light grey or white powdery spots. By conducting an average image study, we aim to investigate whether these visual markers reliably differentiate infected plants from healthy, uninfected ones."


## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks.


## ML Business Case
* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course.


## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items, that your dashboard library supports.
* Finally, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project, you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight, but later, you chose another plot type).


## Unfixed Bugs
* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were unfixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable for consideration, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file. 


## Main Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and from where you got extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials. However, it is necessary to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
